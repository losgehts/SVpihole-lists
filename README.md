# SVpihole-lists
This is a place, I store my blacklists for [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/). Theese lists are based on the project [RPiList](https://github.com/RPiList/specials), but filtered by a whitelist. So it is recommanded to do not use the lists, instead use the lists from [RPiList](https://github.com/RPiList/specials), because the lists in this repo will be less secure.
